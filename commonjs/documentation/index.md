# Ti.DataJS Module

Provides access to Microsoft's DataJS through Titanium. DataJS makes it easy to interact with OData.

## Installation Instructions

There is a "datajs-1.0.3.tijs" file in this module's directory. This must be placed in the Resources directory of your
app, or the world of men will fall, and all will come to darkness, my module to ruin. Do you want that? No. So put it in
the resources directory.

## Methods

### [Ti.DataJS.API][] init(window, readyCallback)
Initializes the DataJS library, hooking it up to the current window, and calling the readyCallback when it is ready to be used.
